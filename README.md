### How do I get set up? ###
To run this bot you will need a ES6 node environment. The bot currently does not have database functions.

1) Create a role called mod and give it the following privileges:
- Display role members separately from online members
- Manage Roles
- Check all boxes under Text Permissions
2) Create roles (this will take a while):
- currently roles must be completely lowercase or youre going to have a bad time see https://github.com/stefangimmillaro/Professor-Redwood/issues/22
- valor, instinct, and mystic: all with at least: Display role members seperately, Read & Send Messages (recommend unchecking Mention Everyone), and color each team appropriately
- create one role for each region that you plan to use. Regions consist of multiple channels. Channels consist of multiple neighborhoods. Examples in SF are: sf, peninsula, sanjose, eastbay
- create a role named 'allregions'
- create a role for each rare pokemon, Tier 3-5 raid boss, and 'highiv', 'legendary', 'finalevo'. **All of these roles must have the 'allow anyone to @mention this role'
3) Create Channels:
- professor_redwood (a channel specifically for bot commands) - @everyone may Read & Send messages
- gymraids_alerts (required for alert forwarding) - only admin/mod/3 teams should have Send Message privilege, @everyone should have no privilege
- start_here (required for instructing users on bot usage) - only admin/mod roles should have Send Message privilege, @everyone should have Read only
- neighborhood channels! When creating these, make sure to use '-' in each name, even if it's at the beginning or end. Proper examples are pier39-marina and sanjose-
-- make sure to only allow allregions and the appropriate region role to access each channel
- regional gym channels, each region role you created should have a corresponding gym channel, called gymraids_ + the name of your region role
