### How do I get set up? ###
To run this bot you will need a ES6 node environment. The bot currently does not have database functions.

1) Create a role called mod and give it the following privileges:
- Display role members separately from online members
- Manage Roles
- Check all boxes under Text Permissions

2) Create roles (this will take a while):
- currently roles must be completely lowercase or youre going to have a bad time see https://github.com/stefangimmillaro/Professor-Redwood/issues/22
- valor, instinct, and mystic: all with at least: Display role members seperately, Read & Send Messages (recommend unchecking Mention Everyone), and color each team   appropriately
- create one role for each region that you plan to use. Regions consist of multiple channels. Channels consist of multiple neighborhoods. Examples in SF are: sf, peninsula, sanjose, eastbay
- create a role named 'allregions'
- create a role for each pokemon/quest reward specified in want.js, 'highiv', 'legendary', 'finalevo', 'shinycheck', 'shadow', 'exgym'. **All of these roles must have the 'allow   anyone to @mention this role'

3) Create Channels:
- `professor_redwood` (a channel specifically for bot commands) - @everyone may Read & Send messages
- `missing_dex` (required for Wild report alert forwarding) - only admin/mod should have Send Message privilege, everyone else should have read only privilege
- `gymraids_alerts` (required for egg/raid alert forwarding) - only admin/mod should have Send Message privilege, everyone ele should have read only privilege
- `gymraids_+ the name of your region role` - Alert forwarding specific to reports from the neighborhoods in a region
- `tr_alerts` (required for Team Rocket alert forwarding) - only admin/mod/3 teams should have Send Message privilege, @everyone should have no privilege
- `tr_alerts__+ the name of your region role` - Alert forwarding specific to reports from the neighborhoods in a region
- `quests_alerts` (required for quest alert forwarding) - only admin/mod/3 teams should have Send Message privilege, @everyone should have no privilege
- `quests_+ the name of your region role` - Alert forwarding specific to reports from the neighborhoods in a region
- `adventure_rules` - Server rules page - only admin/mod roles should have Send Message privilege, @everyone should have Read only
- `bot_commands` - List of all bot commands - only admin/mod roles should have Send Message privilege, @everyone should have Read only
- neighborhood channels! When creating these, make sure to use '-' in each name, even if it's at the beginning or end. Proper examples are `pier39-marina` and `sanjose-`
  --> NOTE: make sure to only allow `allregions` and the appropriate region role to access each channel
